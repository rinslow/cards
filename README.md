# Python CLI Game Template

A simple and minimalistic template for building command-line games in Python.

## Features

- Clean, object-oriented structure
- Main game loop with menu system
- Input handling with error management
- Easy to extend and customize

## Getting Started

1. Run the game:
```bash
python game.py
```

2. Customize the game by modifying the `Game` class methods:
   - `play()` - Implement your game logic
   - `show_instructions()` - Add game rules
   - Add new methods as needed

## Structure

- `game.py` - Main game file with the `Game` class
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies (currently empty)

## Example Usage

The template includes a basic menu system:
- Play - Start the game
- Instructions - Show game rules
- Quit - Exit the game

Extend the `Game` class to implement your specific game mechanics.
